***Tower Defence***
The files required to run our demo1 code are as follows:
 
  1)DemoRunner.java
  2)Tower.java
  3)MapUnderlier.java
  4)Enemy.java
  5)Display.jav
  
  put these files all into one chosen directory.
  
  The code is run through "DemoRunner", so be sure to compile that java file.
